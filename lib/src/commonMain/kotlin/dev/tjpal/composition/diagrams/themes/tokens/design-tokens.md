# Design Tokens
Each component shall be configurable via design tokens. Design tokens are the atomic pieces of a design system — they are named entities that store visual design attributes. These attributes can include colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and more.
Also, for each set of design tokens an actual configuration is required in the corresponding theme directory.
